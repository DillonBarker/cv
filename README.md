## Dillon Barker

I am a 2019 Biochemistry with Biotechnology graduate from the University of Birmingham. I have always preferred computer work to lab work, as a result since finishing University I went to work learning more about coding and programming and now I am enrolled onto the Makers Programming Course.

## Skills

- Problem solving
- Team work

#### Problem solving

I have always enjoyed having problems to solve, it gives you a lot of structure and there is always a better way of doing something. This is great for progression as you learn new skills, you can go back to various challenges you have tackled and improve on them.

Whilst at University I excelled in problem solving, especially at the math based thermodynamics problem solving test, achieving above 90% in a third year exam.

Since starting Makers I have worked a lot on Codewars in the Ruby language. I have solved problems, and then gone back to these a week or so later and greatly simplified my code making it more readable and understanding for others.

A few months a go I went to work building a website portfolio for myself using GitHub pages. This was a great challenge as it involved a lot of coding skills and understanding that I did not have. However, through lots of effort fixing various page issues through googling and learning I was able to build a great website and even add a blog to it.

#### Team work

From a very young age I was involved in a variety of team based sports, such as football, rugby and tennis (doubles). This gave me a range of communication skills, which I have developed over the years. Most of this development came from my first job as a football coach. Where I was responsible from the age of 15 to lead my own drills and teach a number of different age groups.

Following on from this it gave me experience of leadership as I was able to give people the skills that I had learnt, going into University I found myself in group projects often leading as I was able to talk through our plans and get the group to come to agreements on topics and content.

An example of this is where I led a group to produce a video highlighting the science behind addiction, here I made myself responsible for the group and organised meetings and made sure we were done on time.
